| **Purpose**                    | To **reduce security risk by minimizing the attack surface** [1]. This involves removing extra functions/applications, disabling unnecessary services, and changing default passwords [1].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [1]            |
| **Standards & Frameworks**     | Cybersecurity efforts should align with frameworks such as **NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF)**, NIST SP 800-53, and guidelines from **CIS (Center for Internet Security)** [2-4]. SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) enables automated vulnerability management and compliance evaluation [3].                                                                                                                                                                      | [2-4]          |
| **Network Hardening**          | Block unnecessary inbound/outbound ports (e.g., RDP 3389, SMB 139/445, SMTP 25) [5]. Use secure management protocols like **SSH instead of Telnet** and **SNMPv3** [5, 6]. Deploy public-facing systems within a **DMZ** (DeMilitarized Zone) [7, 8]. Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all remote access systems (VPNs) [6, 7, 9].                                                                                                                            | [5-7]          |
| **Windows & Active Directory** | Implement hardening demonstrations on Windows systems (servers and workstations) [10, 11]. Use **GPOs (Group Policy Objects)** and **LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)** for managing local administrator accounts [12-14]. Secure Domain Controllers (DCs) by running them in Server Core deployments and restricting access [11]. Use application whitelisting (e.g., Windows Defender Application Control) [15-17]. Use **BitLocker** for encryption [15, 18, 19]. | [11-13, 15-18] |
| **Linux & Other Systems**      | Secure Linux using methods like **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux), **Fail2ban** (Intrusion Prevention System against brute force), and local firewalls (Iptables/UFW) [20, 21]. Network segmentation is critical for Printers, IoT, and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) [22, 23].                                                                                                                                                                                           | [21-23]        |


The fundamental goal of hardening is to **reduce security risk by minimizing the attack surface**. This is achieved by removing extraneous applications and disabling unnecessary services.

| Technical Domain | Key Concepts & Implementations | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Guidelines & Frameworks** | Utilize the **NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF)** and **Special Publication 800-53**. Adopt **CIS Controls and Benchmarks** for configuration guidance. Leverage the **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)** (defined by NIST SP 800-126) for automated vulnerability management, policy compliance evaluation, and scoring. | |
| **Network Device Hardening** | Use secure management protocols exclusively: **SSH** (Secure Shell) instead of Telnet, **SNMPv3** (with MIB whitelisting), and **SCP** (Secure Copy Protocol) or **SFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol) instead of FTP. Block vulnerable inbound/outbound ports such as RDP (**3389**), SMB (**139, 445**), and SMTP (**25**). Wireless security must use **WPA3 SAE** or **WPA2 Enterprise** (leveraging 802.1x authentication). | |
| **Windows Systems & AD** | Implement centralized security via **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** for policy enforcement. Use **LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)** to ensure unique, complex passwords for local administrative accounts on endpoints. Secure Domain Controllers (DCs) using **Server Core deployments** and restrict additional software installation. Deploy **Application Whitelisting** using **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)** (preferred over AppLocker) to control executables and drivers. Enforce full disk encryption using **BitLocker** (with recovery keys stored in Active Directory for domain-joined systems). | |
| **Linux Hardening** | Utilize **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)** for robust architectural access control. Deploy **Fail2ban** as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to protect against brute-force attacks by monitoring log files. Implement local firewalls using **Iptables**, **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall, default on Ubuntu), or **Firewalld**. Disable direct root login, instead favoring `sudo` from a normal user account. Secure SSH access by using cryptographic keys with passphrases. | |
| **Other Endpoints (IoT/ICS)** | Network segmentation is **critical** for IoT devices (e.g., cameras, smart locks). For printers and multifunction peripherals (MFPs), change default SNMP strings and passwords, and restrict administrative access. | |

Cybersecurity Hardening is the foundational process of applying **tools, techniques, and best practices to reduce system vulnerability**. The primary goal is to **reduce security risk by minimizing the attack surface**. This is achieved by removing extra functions and applications, disabling unnecessary services, and changing default passwords/accounts. Hardening ensures **consistency among infrastructure (with baselines)** and helps improve compliance and audit capabilities.

## 1. Principles, Guidelines, and Frameworks

Hardening efforts must be structured using formal documentation and adherence to global standards.

*   **Baselines:** Security efforts require the **creation, use, and verification of baselines**. These are formally documented snapshots of security configurations that serve as a crucial reference for routinely auditing systems.
*   **SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol):** SCAP is a method using specific standards to enable **automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation**. Its technical specifications are defined in **NIST SP 800-126** and it integrates with NIST SP 800-53.
*   **NIST Frameworks:** The **NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF)** guides organizations in managing and reducing risk, based on existing standards. **NIST Special Publication 800-53** provides specific security controls.
*   **CIS (Center for Internet Security):** CIS provides the **CIS Controls** (recommended actions for cyber defense) and **CIS Benchmarks** (configuration guidelines for multiple products). They also offer **CIS Hardened Images**.
*   **CISA/US-CERT:** These agencies analyze and reduce cyber threats and vulnerabilities and coordinate incident response activities.

## 2. Network and Perimeter Hardening

Network hardening focuses on securing the **first line of defense** against attacks and restricting management access.

| Technical Area | Hardening Requirements | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protocol Security** | Disable insecure management protocols. Use **SSH instead of Telnet**, **SNMPv3 w/MIB whitelisting**, and **SFTP or SCP instead of FTP**. | |
| **Port Restriction** | **Block unnecessary inbound/outbound ports**, specifically including **RDP (3389), SMB (139, 445), and SMTP (25)**. | |
| **DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)** | A network segment used for public systems (Web servers, VPN termination points, edge email servers). DMZ systems must be **patched and updated**. | |
| **Remote Access** | **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should always be used** for remote access gateways (VPN, storefront). Remote access should **restrict access to internal resources** based on the **least privilege** principle. | |
| **Network Devices** | Change default passwords, disable unused services, use secure protocols, and **enable and review logs** by sending them to a **central location**. Central authentication is recommended. | |
| **Wireless Security** | **Never use WEP**. Secure SSIDs must use **WPA2 Enterprise** or **WPA3 SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)/Enterprise**. **NAC (Network Access Control)** can evaluate the security posture of a device before granting access. | |

## 3. Windows Systems and Active Directory Hardening

Windows environments rely on centralized control and GPOs (Group Policy Objects) to enforce security baselines.

*   **Administrative Accounts:** **Create a new admin account**, change its password, and **disable the built-in administrator account**. End-users should **NOT have administrative rights** on workstations to limit potential damage from malware.
*   **Password Management:** Implement **LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)** to ensure local admin accounts on each endpoint use different, complex passwords managed centrally.
*   **Security Controls:** Enforce configuration settings via **GPOs**. Verify the **local firewall is enabled** and blocks all unnecessary connections. Deploy **Windows Defender (or other AV/EDR)**.
*   **Application Whitelisting:** Use **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)**, which controls drivers in addition to applications (WDAC is newer and being updated, unlike the legacy AppLocker).
*   **Encryption:** Implement **BitLocker** (built-in Windows OS encryption) for the entire system drive. Recovery keys for domain-joined systems can be stored in Active Directory.
*   **Domain Controllers (DC):** DCs should be restricted from installing additional software and should ideally run on **Server Core deployments**. Restrict remote access and block internet access for DCs. **Just-in-Time access** should be implemented for temporary elevated administrative rights within AD.

## 4. Linux and Other Endpoints Hardening

Hardening must apply to all network-connected devices, regardless of OS.

| System | Key Hardening Techniques | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linux Management** | Use secure management methods like **SSH** (with passphrase-protected keys) and **SCP**. Login as a normal user and use `sudo`. | |
| **Linux Security** | Implement **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**, a security architecture allowing more control over access. Deploy **Fail2ban** as an **IPS** (Intrusion Prevention System) to monitor log files and protect against brute-force attacks. | |
| **Linux Firewalls** | Utilize options such as **Iptables**, **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall, default on Ubuntu), or **Firewalld**. | |
| **IoT/ICS Devices** | **Network segmentation is critical** for securing IoT devices (thermostats, cameras). Apply all general hardening guidelines to **ICS (Industrial Control Systems)**, such as SCADA and DCS. | |
| **Printers/MFPs** | Change default passwords and **default SNMP strings**. Ensure sensitive information is **not stored locally** on the device. | |
| **Mac Computers** | Use **FileVault** for disk encryption. Implement **MFA on the iCloud account**. | |
