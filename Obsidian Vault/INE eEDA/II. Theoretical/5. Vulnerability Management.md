This module details the process of identifying, scoring, and remediating weaknesses.

| Concept | Key Details & Objectives | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vulnerability Definition** | A weakness that could be exploited by a threat source [83]. Causes include system misconfigurations, unpatched systems (even old vulnerabilities like EternalBlue are exploited) [84-86]. **Zero-days (0day)** are previously unknown, actively exploited vulnerabilities [84]. | [83, 84, 86] |
| **Scanning Process** | Scanners inventory systems, perform port scans, and check service versions against known vulnerabilities [87, 88]. Scans can be **Authenticated** (better data) or Unauthenticated, and Internal or External (testing the perimeter) [89, 90]. | [87-90] |
| **Scoring (CVSS)** | The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** assigns severity levels: Low (0.1–3.9), Medium (4.0–6.9), High (7.0–8.9), and **Critical (9.0–10)** [90-92]. Higher scores dictate prioritization of remediation [93]. | [90-92] |
| **Resources** | **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) catalogs publicly disclosed vulnerabilities [91]. **NVD** (National Vulnerability Database), managed by NIST, provides enhanced information, including CVSS scores and fix information [92]. | [91, 92] |
| **Risk Analysis** | The VM process must integrate with organizational **Risk Analysis**, which identifies critical assets, potential threats, and the financial impact of exploitation [93, 94]. | [93, 94] |
| **Reporting** | Reports must be tailored to the audience and "tell a story" [95, 96]. **Executive Summaries** provide high-level context for leadership, while **Technical Reports** provide detailed steps and remediation options for IT teams [97]. | [95, 97] |
| **VM Operations** | VM should be a continuous, repeating cycle integrated with the Change Management process [96, 98]. Steps include defining scope, scanning, compiling reports, prioritizing next steps (often via a Vulnerability Team meeting), testing remediation, and applying fixes [99]. | [98, 99] |

Vulnerability Management focuses on identifying and remediating weaknesses (vulnerabilities) that could be exploited by a threat source.

| Technical Domain | Key Concepts & Implementations | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Scanners collect system inventory, perform port checks, and analyze service versions. **Authenticated scans** (using credentials) provide significantly more accurate data than unauthenticated scans. Internal scans provide visibility of post-compromise attack view, while external scans test perimeter controls. | |
| **Vulnerability Scoring** | The **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)** is the standard for assigning severity. Scores range from Non (0) to **Critical (9.0–10.0)**. The score calculation is based on **Exploitability** (e.g., Attack Vector, Privileges Needed) and the **Impact to the CIA Triad**. | |
| **Research & Resources** | **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**, operated by MITRE, catalogs publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4J CVE-2021-44228). The **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)**, managed by NIST, enhances this data by providing CVSS scores, fix information, and impact ratings. | |
| **Risk & Prioritization** | Prioritization must consider not only the CVSS score but also the **Criticality of the system** and the existence of vendor fixes. Risk analysis requires a full inventory of assets and a determination of the likelihood and business impact of exploitation. | |
| **Reporting & Operations** | Reports must be tailored: **Executive Summaries** for senior leadership (focusing on high-level risk context) and **Technical Reports** for IT teams (detailing vulnerabilities and remediation steps). VM is a continuous cycle integrated with Change Management, requiring regular scanning (often monthly cadence) and team meetings to prioritize remediation. | |

Vulnerability Management (VM) is the structured process of identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating weaknesses in the enterprise environment. The goal is to reduce security risk by ensuring that vulnerabilities (weaknesses that could be exploited by a threat source) are addressed proactively.

## 1. Vulnerability Definition and Causes

A vulnerability is a **weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source**. They provide a means for an attacker to compromise a system or network.

| Category | Examples and Details | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Common Causes** | **System misconfigurations** (e.g., improperly secured S3 buckets), **missing or weak authorization controls** (e.g., default passwords), and **unpatched systems**. Attackers routinely exploit old vulnerabilities, some over five years old, that have available patches. | |
| **Types of Vulnerabilities** | **Buffer overflows**, Remote Code Execution (**RCE**), cross-site scripting (**XSS**), file inclusion, privilege escalation, and inadequate encryption. | |
| **New Discoveries** | **Zero-day (0day)** vulnerabilities are previously unknown and are actively being exploited. They are typically discovered via active attacks in the wild, vendor notifications, or security researcher announcements. | |

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning and Methodology

Vulnerability scanners are systems designed to inventory infrastructure and locate weaknesses, providing scoring and reporting.

### Types of Scans and Configuration

| Scan Type | Technical Purpose and Characteristics | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scanner Function** | Scanners check systems by performing **port scans**, examining **service version information**, and checking **file versions** against known vulnerabilities. | |
| **Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated** | **Authenticated scans will always result in better data** because they run checks locally on the host, using credentials provided to the scanner. Unauthenticated scans provide results closer to an attacker's view of the network. | |
| **Internal vs. External** | **External scans** test perimeter security controls and identify vulnerabilities visible from the internet. **Internal scans** provide more visibility across the internal network, representing the view if an attacker is already inside. | |
| **Scanner Types** | Scanners can be network-based, host-based (agent or agentless), application-focused (e.g., testing web applications for XSS), or database-focused (e.g., improper permissions). | |

### The Scanning Process

The vulnerability management process is a repeating cycle beginning with preparation and ending with verified remediation:

1.  **Configuration:** Define **scope** and build a full asset **inventory**. Assets are assigned to appropriate **asset groups** within the scanner, and scheduled scans are configured (e.g., monthly cadence).
2.  **Scanning:** Execute the scan (internal/external, authenticated/unauthenticated). The process involves verifying the system is online, port scanning, service checking, and comparing findings against known vulnerabilities.
3.  **Reporting:** The scanner automatically generates reports listing the number of informational, low, medium, high, and critical vulnerabilities.
4.  **Remediation:** Highly dependent on the specific vulnerability and system. Requires downtime assessment and **testing in a test environment** before applying to production.

## 3. Vulnerability Scoring and Research

Scoring provides an at-a-glance severity level, allowing organizations to **prioritize work and resources** for speedy response.

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

*   **Standardization:** **CVSS** is the standard used for assigning scores to vulnerabilities.
*   **Severity Levels (Base Score):** CVSS scores range from **Non (0)**, Low (0.1–3.9), Medium (4.0–6.9), High (7.0–8.9), to **Critical (9.0–10)**.
*   **Calculation Factors:** The score is calculated based on metrics including **Exploitability** (e.g., Attack Vector, Privileges Needed, User Interaction) and the **Impact to the CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

### Research Resources

*   **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** Operated by MITRE, it **identifies, defines, and catalogs publicly disclosed vulnerabilities** using unique identifiers (CVE-YYYY-NNNN...).
*   **NVD (National Vulnerability Database):** Managed by **NIST**, NVD is the US government repository that provides **enhanced information** (data fed by CVE), including **CVSS scores**, vendor fixes, impact ratings, and enhanced searching abilities.

## 4. Risk Analysis and Prioritization

Vulnerability risk analysis involves evaluating known risks using risk assessment procedures. Prioritization determines which vulnerabilities require immediate attention.

*   **Risk Definition:** Risk is the **likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability**. It links vulnerability, threat, and the likelihood of exploitation together with the **business impact**.
*   **Process Integration:** VM requires a **full inventory of all systems and resources** (including priority tiering).
*   **Prioritization Factors:** Evaluation must consider the CVSS score, the **criticality of the system** in the environment, the prevalence of the vulnerability, and the potential **impact to the organization** (e.g., loss of revenue, data breach).
*   **Remediation Steps:** Identify if a **vendor fix is available** (patch). If not, identify other mitigations, such as compensating security controls (e.g., WAF, enhanced firewall rules).

## 5. Vulnerability Reporting and Operations

### Reporting Requirements

Vulnerability reports must **"tell a story with the data"**. They should be customized for the audience:

| Report Type | Audience | Content Focus | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Executive Summary** | Senior leadership | High-level overview, summarizing the potential risk and cost implications. | |
| **Technical Report** | Technical IT Teams | Detailed listing of all found vulnerabilities, including **how they were/could be exploited** and specific remediation options. | |
| **Scanner Reports** | Internal security team | Raw or initial reports from the scanning tool; should **NOT** be given directly to leadership without manual compilation and context. | |

### VM Operations Lifecycle

Vulnerability Management must be a **well-defined and followed repeating cycle**, ideally run on a **monthly cadence**, and **integrating tightly with Change Management (CM)**.

1.  **Analysis and Compilation:** Analyze scanner reports and compile customized reports for various teams.
2.  **Prioritization Meeting:** Hold a **Vulnerability Team meeting** involving IT, Security, and management to prioritize next steps and allocate resources.
3.  **Change Management (CM):** All remediation actions (patches, configuration changes) must follow the **Change Management process**.
4.  **Remediation:** Technical IT teams implement fixes, which must be **tested in a non-production test environment** before being applied to production systems.
5.  **Verification:** Apply fixes to production and immediately **test them again**.

***
**Technical Note on Hardening and Remediation:**

Vulnerability Management directly addresses the goal of **reducing the attack surface** by remediating misconfigurations. Remediation often involves technical hardening steps covered in other modules, such as:
*   Enforcing **LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)** to ensure unique administrative passwords across endpoints.
*   Applying **GPOs (Group Policy Objects)** to centralize security baselines across Windows systems.
*   Disabling unnecessary services and closing unnecessary ports (e.g., RDP 3389, SMB 139/445).
