Security Engineers focuses on technical, proactive implementation and configuration of security controls.

| Technical Domain | Key Concepts & Implementations | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Perimeter Controls** | Utilize Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW) and **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)** (e.g., protecting against XSS or SQL Injection). The **DMZ** (DeMilitarized Zone) is the secure segment for public-facing assets (Web servers, VPN terminators, Edge email servers). Deploy **IDS/IPS** systems (Host-based or Network-based) for detection and blocking. | |
| **Network Segmentation** | Use **VLANs** (Virtual Local Area Networks) for logical separation and **ACLs** (Access Control Lists) on switches/routers to enforce communication limits. **NAC (Network Access Control)** identifies new devices and assesses their security posture (e.g., AV status, update compliance) before granting access. | |
| **Change Management (CM)** | CM is a structured process required due to the rapid evolution of security. Changes are categorized as **Planned Major Changes**, routine **Break/Fix**, or time-critical **Emergency Changes** (requiring an abbreviated process followed by a Root Cause Analysis). All changes should be tested in a **Test/Development environment** (a duplicate of production) prior to deployment in **Production**. | |
| **GRC Fundamentals** | **Governance** ensures alignment with strategic business goals, often driven by C-Suite leadership. **Compliance** requires adherence to binding regulations (e.g., **GDPR** imposing fines up to 4% of global revenue; **HIPAA** for US healthcare) or standards (e.g., **PCI-DSS** for credit card handling). | |

This module details the technical, proactive role of the Security Engineer and establishes the critical importance of Change Management (CM) and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) in maintaining enterprise security posture.

## 1. Security Engineering Role and Domains

Security Engineering is a **technical position** focused on **proactive work**, including implementing, configuring, and monitoring security controls. The role requires developing and enforcing security plans and procedures.

### The Security Engineer's Focus

| Responsibility | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Control Implementation** | Configuring security controls and setting up security systems/appliances. |
| **Policy & Management** | Assisting with policy creation and managing/tweaking existing security controls. |
| **Risk Context** | All engineering decisions must be made within the context of the organization's **budget** and its **acceptable level of risk**. |

### Security Domains

Security engineering controls are often categorized into three primary areas:

1.  **Perimeter Security**
    *   **Definition:** The first line of defense, containing firewalls, public access, and VPN access points.
    *   **Controls:** Firewalls monitor traffic, permitting or blocking based on rules. Use **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for all remote access systems (VPN, storefronts).
    *   **Hardening:** Block unnecessary inbound/outbound ports (e.g., **RDP 3389, SMB 139/445, SMTP 25**). Use secure management protocols like **SSH instead of Telnet** and **SNMPv3**.
    *   **DMZ:** A network segment used for public systems (Web servers, Edge Email Servers, VPN termination points) that separates them from the internal network.

2.  **Network Security**
    *   **Definition:** Protecting the internal network to isolate and contain attacks.
    *   **Segmentation:** Achieved through **VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)** for logical separation and **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**, which are rules defining what systems can communicate. **NAC (Network Access Control)** evaluates the security posture of devices before granting network access.
    *   **Active Directory (AD):** Used as the central database and structure for Windows networks, enforcing security controls through **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**.
    *   **Goal:** Enforce the principles of **Least Privilege** and **Separation of Duties** to prevent lateral movement of threats.

3.  **Endpoint Security**
    *   **Definition:** Securing workstations and servers where end-users operate.
    *   **Controls:** End-users should **not be local administrators** to limit potential damage from malware and prevent unwanted software installation. Use **UAC (User Account Control)** to limit application access. Deploy **EDR/AV** (Endpoint Detection and Response/Anti-virus), noting that AMP (Advanced Malware Protection) is behavior-based.
    *   **Encryption & DLP:** Use **Encryption** (e.g., BitLocker for full system drive encryption on Windows) to protect sensitive data. Implement **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** to protect confidential data (PHI, PII, PCI data) from leaving the organization (via email, removable media, or storage).
    *   **Virtualization (VDI):** Virtual Desktop Infrastructure can offer more centralized control, easier deployment, centralized updating, and rapid containment/mitigation of attacks (e.g., deleting and redeploying a compromised workstation).

## 2. Change Management (CM)

Change Management is a **structured plan and process** for introducing changes, critical because security is rapidly evolving. **Communication and documentation are key** to maintaining accountability and tracking the environment.

### Baselines and Change Detection

CM relies on **baselines**, which are documented snapshots of the software and hardware configuration at a point in time, used as a reference for comparison against unauthorized changes.

| Type of Change | Characteristics | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Planned Major Changes** | Larger scale changes (e.g., new equipment or vendors). Requires **thorough research and documentation** and takes longer to implement. | Follows the entire CM process. |
| **Break/Fix or Maintenance** | Typically non-downtime issues (e.g., routine maintenance, simple hardware upgrades). | Shorter timeframes, normally scheduled. |
| **Emergency Changes** | **Major issues** that must be addressed **immediately** (e.g., a critical system down, major security vulnerability identified). | Uses an **abbreviated process** followed by a **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**. |

### The CM Process Lifecycle

The CM process is highly situational but follows a core five-step lifecycle:

1.  **Change Introduction:** The change is initially proposed (submission process), gathering basic information about the vendor or department involved.
2.  **Research & Documentation:** The bulk of documentation is formalized here, including whitepapers, vendor documentation, security documentation, attestation, and deployment diagrams. An implementation timeline is developed.
3.  **Review:** Stakeholders (IT, Cyber Security, Project Owners) review the consolidated documentation and timeline. Additional questions are asked before approval or denial.
4.  **Implement:** The verified implementation timeline is executed. Goals and milestones are established, resources are allocated, and **baselines are established and verified**.
5.  **Learn:** This is a continuous process, often formalized in a meeting, where teams discuss successes, roadblocks, and potential improvements (often involving **RCA**).

### Change Environments

Changes must be segregated into specific environments to protect business continuity:

*   **Production:** The main network where systems operate. Changes should **not be tested here** as downtime affects the business.
*   **Test/Development:** A duplicate (complete or partial) of the production environment used to **test and adjust changes**. This ensures that if problems arise, there is no loss of business functions.

## 3. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

GRC is a structured approach used to align IT with business objectives, ensuring the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is maintained.

| GRC Component | Focus and Responsibility | Regulatory Examples | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance** | Ensures organizational activities are **aligned with business goals**. Provides the direction and guidance for the security program, typically set by senior leadership (Top-Down Approach). | Organizational structure, policies, change management. | |
| **Risk** | The **likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability**. Risk management is the process of identifying and mitigating risks to an **acceptable level** (risk appetite). Zero risk is impossible. | Risk Assessment Process (NIST SP 800-30, OCTAVE, FRAP). | |
| **Compliance** | The process ensuring all business activities **meet laws and regulations**. Non-compliance can lead to **financial or legal penalties**. | **HIPAA** (US healthcare privacy), **GDPR** (EU data protection, penalties up to 4% of global revenue), **PCI-DSS** (contractually required standard). | |
