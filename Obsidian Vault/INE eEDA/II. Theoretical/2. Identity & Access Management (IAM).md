This module focuses on controlling who can access enterprise resources.

| Concept | Key Details & Objectives | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AAA** | Identity (claiming) -> **Authentication** (proving identity, e.g., password, MFA) -> **Authorization** (verifying access rights/permissions) -> **Accounting** (logging user actions for accountability/auditing) [24, 25]. | [24-26] |
| **Authentication Types** | **Knowledge-based** ("something you know," e.g., passwords) [27]; **Ownership-based** ("something you have," e.g., tokens, smart cards) [27, 28]; **Biometric** ("something you are or do," physiological or behavioral) [28]. **MFA** uses two or more distinct types [29]. | [27-29] |
| **Password Management** | Passwords should be hashed with "salt" [29]. NIST SP 800-63B recommends a minimum of 8 characters (max 64) and suggests **not requiring arbitrary password changes** (as this encourages easier-to-crack passwords) [30]. | [30] |
| **Authorization Mechanisms** | **Least Privilege** is fundamental [31, 32]. Preferred models include **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**, where permissions are assigned to job roles/groups, simplifying administration [33, 34]. Other models include DAC (Discretionary), MAC (Mandatory), and ABAC (Attribute-Based) [35, 36]. | [32, 33, 35, 36] |
| **Advanced Access** | **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access** provisions elevated permissions granularly and temporarily (e.g., 30 minutes) for a specific task [37, 38]. This helps prevent **Authorization Creep** (retaining old access after role changes) [34, 39]. | [37, 39] |
| **A&A Systems** | Includes **Kerberos** (uses tickets to eliminate constant password authentication) [40, 41], **SAML** (Security Assertion Markup Language, for SSO between systems) [40], and **RADIUS** (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) [42]. **Active Directory** (AD) uses an LDAP directory database as the central platform for identity management [43, 44]. | [40, 41, 44] |
| **IAM Lifecycle** | Consists of **Provisioning** (account creation) [45, 46], routine **Access Reviews** (to ensure adherence to least privilege) [46, 47], and **Deprovisioning** (disabling and removing rights when employees leave) [47]. HR integrations streamline this cycle [48]. | [45, 47, 48] |

IAM is the critical process of managing identity and controlling resource access via **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**.

| Technical Domain | Key Concepts & Implementations | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication (A)** | Authentication verifies identity using credentials (passwords, cryptographic keys, biometrics). **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** combines two or more distinct types (Knowledge, Ownership, Biometric) and is required for remote access and sensitive data. SMS is considered an insecure method for MFA. | |
| **Password Management** | Passwords must be stored using a **one-way hash** combined with a **salt**. NIST SP 800-63B guidelines recommend a minimum of **8 characters** (up to 64) and advise against requiring arbitrary, frequent password changes, as this encourages weaker passwords. Passwords should be checked against dictionary lists and compromised lists. | |
| **Authorization (A)** | The goal is **Least Privilege** and **Separation of Duties**. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** assigns permissions to groups/roles rather than individual users, greatly easing administration and auditing. Authorization models also include DAC (Discretionary) and MAC (Mandatory, often integrated into OS kernel). | |
| **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access** | JIT provisions elevated access granularly and temporarily (e.g., 30 minutes) only for a specific task. This mechanism directly combats **Authorization Creep** (retaining old access after role changes). Requests for JIT access are logged and may require manual review/approval. | |
| **A&A Systems** | **Kerberos** uses tickets (**TGT**, Ticket Granting Ticket) issued by the **KDC** (Key Distribution Center) and **TGS** (Ticket Granting Service) to eliminate the need for constant password re-authentication. **SAML** (Security Assertion Markup Language) facilitates **Single Sign-On (SSO)** between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider. **Active Directory** uses an **LDAP** directory database for centralized identity management. | |
| **IAM Lifecycle** | Provisioning (account creation), routine **Access Reviews** (to verify adherence to least privilege), and **Deprovisioning** (disabling accounts, removing rights, transferring file ownership). Integration with HR systems significantly automates this cycle, especially for account disablement upon termination. | |

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a critical component of enterprise defense, focusing on the management of digital identities and the control of access to organizational resources. The primary goal of an IAM program is to ensure that only authenticated individuals can access systems and that users can only access resources they have rights to.

## 1. Core Principles: AAA

IAM is built upon four foundational concepts: Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).

| Concept | Technical Function | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identification** | Claiming a specific identity (e.g., a username). | |
| **Authentication** | The process where identity is **proven and verified** using credentials (passwords, cryptographic keys, biometrics). | |
| **Authorization** | The verification that a user is permitted to access a specific resource or perform an action (e.g., permissions, Access Control Lists - ACLs). This is an ongoing process that occurs every time resource access is attempted. | |
| **Accounting** | Logging and auditing user actions to ensure **accountability**. This provides evidence of what occurred, assists in incident response, and deters malicious actions. | |

## 2. Authentication Types and Password Management

Strong authentication is paramount, utilizing multiple factors to verify identity.

### Types of Authentication

Authentication methods are based on distinct factors:

1.  **Knowledge-Based:** "Something you know" (e.g., passwords, passphrases, cognitive passwords). This is the most common, but also the most vulnerable type.
2.  **Ownership-Based:** "Something you have" (e.g., physical tokens, software on a smartphone, cryptographic keys, smart cards). One-Time Passwords (OTP) are typically seen as codes displayed on a device or delivered via SMS, although **SMS is considered an insecure method**.
3.  **Biometric:** "Something you are or do" (e.g., fingerprints, eye scans (physiological), or typing dynamics (behavioral)). This is more difficult and expensive to implement, usually reserved for sensitive data/systems.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA requires using **two or more forms** of authentication to verify identity. MFA should always be used for remote access gateways, sensitive data access, administration of core systems, and mobile devices.

### Password Mechanics and NIST Guidelines

*   **Storage:** Passwords must be secured using a **one-way hash** combined with a **salt**. They should never be stored in plaintext.
*   **NIST SP 800-63B Recommendations:** This guideline advocates for strong password policies.
    *   Minimum length of **8 characters** and a maximum of **64 characters**.
    *   Allows all ASCII and Unicode characters.
    *   **Do not require arbitrary password changes** (as this encourages users to choose simpler, easier-to-crack passwords).
    *   Passwords should be checked against dictionary lists, compromised lists, and for repetitive or sequential characters.
*   **Password Resets:** Self-service password resets require verification, which should **never** use publicly available information (like a mother’s maiden name).
*   **Password Managers:** These applications allow for secure password storage and encryption, often using a "master password," and are recommended for using unique passwords across every system.

## 3. Authorization Mechanisms and Controls

Authorization controls dictate *what* an authenticated user can access, emphasizing the principles of **Least Privilege (LP)** and **Separation of Duties**.

| Mechanism | Technical Description | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** | Users who own a file or resource have full permissions and can directly assign permissions to others using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**. This poses a high risk if the owner is an administrator. | |
| **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** | A highly secure model where users have no discretion over access rights. Built around security labels and clearance levels (e.g., **SELinux** uses this behind the scenes). | |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Access is assigned based on defined job duties or **roles**, not individual identities. Permissions are assigned to groups, and users are assigned to those groups. RBAC significantly eases administration, management, and auditing. | |
| **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** | Access is determined dynamically based on various attributes of the subject (user), the object (resource), the action requested, and the context (time, location). | |
| **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access** | A method to temporarily provision **elevated access on demand** for a limited time (e.g., 30 minutes) and for a granular, specific task (e.g., a software install or an AD modification). This helps prevent Authorization Creep. | |
| **Authorization Creep** | Occurs when access rights are retained after a job change or promotion. This violates the principle of Least Privilege. | |

## 4. Authentication and Authorization Systems

Modern enterprises rely on centralized systems and standardized protocols for identity management.

| System/Protocol | Purpose and Function | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Directory Services (LDAP/AD)** | Directory services provide the central platform for managing unique identities, authentication credentials, and permissions. **Active Directory (AD)** utilizes an **LDAP directory database** for its core services (ADDS). | |
| **Kerberos** | An authentication system that uses **symmetric key cryptography**. It eliminates constant password authentication by issuing tickets (**TGT** - Ticket Granting Ticket) from the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** and the **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**. | |
| **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** | An open standard that allows **Single Sign-On (SSO)** between an Identity Provider (IdP) (authentication source) and a Service Provider. | |
| **SSO (Single Sign-On)** | Allows a single login to gain access to multiple web-based systems, which simplifies management but increases risk if the single credential is compromised (requires MFA). | |
| **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)** | An open protocol frequently used for **centralized authentication** for wireless access (802.1x) and VPN access. | |
| **OAuth** | An open standard consisting of four roles (Client, Resource Server, Authorization Server, Resource Owner) that allows authorization across third parties. | |

## 5. The IAM Lifecycle and Auditing

The IAM lifecycle is a crucial process for maintaining system security, especially in a dynamic organization where people change positions or leave.

### IAM Lifecycle Steps

1.  **Provisioning:** Creating accounts and assigning initial access, ideally based on roles (RBAC). The process must document **"Why was this account created/permission granted?"**.
2.  **Access Reviews:** Routine, scheduled reviews to verify that users retain only the access required for their current job duties, helping to combat Authorization Creep and ensuring adherence to Least Privilege.
3.  **Deprovisioning:** The critically important process for **removing access** when an employee leaves. Accounts must be **disabled**, rights removed, ownership transferred, and eventually deleted. Failure to remove access creates "perfect targets for attackers".

### Auditing and Logging

Accounting and auditing ensure users are accountable for their actions.

*   **Logging Requirements:** Logs must include date/time (synchronized across all systems using NTP), successful and failed login/logout events, account modifications (password/group changes), and source/destination information.
*   **Privileged Accounts:** Special attention and enhanced logging must be applied to privileged accounts (admin, root, system).
*   **Protection:** Logs must be protected from unauthorized viewing, modification, or deletion. Centralized logging is highly recommended to offload logs and protect them from attackers who frequently delete logs to cover their tracks.
*   **Reviews:** Log reviews can be automated (using SIEM/SOAR) or manual, with analysts trained to look for suspicious or unusual activity.
