This final module focuses on operational tasks, network evaluation, and certification readiness.

| Concept | Key Details & Objectives | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Documentation** | Security engineers may write or review **Business Proposals** (justification for purchases) [118], assist with **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** (identifying impacts on processes) [119], and review **Statements of Work (SOW)** (specific project requirements) [120]. | [118-120] |
| **Evaluating Existing Networks** | Follow a structured process: verify asset inventory and existing documentation, perform risk and vulnerability assessments (starting with critical systems), review existing security controls (hardening, firewall rules) [121-124]. Finally, compile results/recommendations and **implement changes following the Change Management process** [125, 126]. | [121-125] |
| **Creating New Networks** | Start with business needs, perform risk assessments, and use frameworks like NIST CSF or CIS Controls [127]. Implementation must prioritize **secure defaults** and **privacy by design** [128]. Documentation (CM, baselines, policies) and follow-up (VM program, training, audits) are critical from the beginning [129, 130]. | [127, 128, 130] |
| **eEDA Exam** | The eEDA exam includes independent (multiple choice/scenario) questions and a **hands-on practical portion in a lab environment** (Sandbox EDA) [130, 131]. Candidates can use external resources (command/vendor documentation), but not other people, during the exam [131]. | [130, 131] |


## 1. Business Documentation and Planning

Effective security engineering requires the proper creation, review, and application of documentation, ensuring alignment between IT activities and business needs.

| Document Type | Purpose and Engineer's Role | Technical Details and Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Proposal (BP)** | Used to request or review purchases of products or services, whether internal or external. | Must include **justification of need** and cost information, often incorporating an associated Risk Assessment or **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**. |
| **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** | A process to identify critical business processes and potential negative impacts caused by specific events. | The scope can vary significantly, from the entire organization (for business continuity planning) to a narrow analysis of a single event or risk. The Security Engineer assists with analysis and data gathering for the BIA. |
| **Statement of Work (SOW)** | Describes the detailed requirements for a service or product, defining the overall purpose, specific goals, and steps required. | Helps ensure all project pieces are documented, defining clear expectations and assisting with **avoiding scope creep**. The Security Engineer primarily reviews and follows the SOW. |

## 2. Evaluating an Existing Network

Evaluation is a structured, ongoing process necessary because security needs are rapidly evolving. All subsequent configuration changes must adhere to the **Change Management (CM) process**.

| Phase | Technical Activities and Focus | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inventory & Documentation** | **Complete and accurate inventory is critical**; assets cannot be protected if their existence is unknown. Review all existing documentation, including network diagrams, security policies, procedures, and baselines. | |
| **Assessments** | Perform **Risk Assessments** starting with the **most critical systems** identified during inventory. Conduct **Vulnerability Assessments** on all systems, starting with higher priority ones. | |
| **Review Controls** | Assess standard hardening techniques on servers, network devices, and endpoints. Verify configurations of security devices (Firewalls, IPS, SIEM, email filtering) and confirm centralized logging configurations are appropriate. **No configuration changes** should be made at this stage. | |
| **Recommendations** | Compile results and formulate recommendations, which may include changes to system configurations or new security controls. Reports should detail how **not implementing changes** would affect the organization (BIA). | |
| **Implementation** | **Follow change management processes**. Prioritize changes based on the **criticality of systems/risks** (e.g., open external firewall rules are high priority). Document all changes, create/update **baselines**, and perform follow-up assessments to verify success. | |

## 3. Creating New Secure Networks (Proactive Design)

When designing a new network, security must be **considered from the beginning**. The goal is to balance security with usability.

| Principle | Configuration and Implementation Requirements | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Design Frameworks** | Use established frameworks and best practices, such as **NIST CSF** and **CIS Controls/Benchmarks**, and document all plans prior to implementation. | |
| **Secure Defaults** | All systems must be deployed using **secure defaults**. This means starting in an extremely secure configuration with **no default passwords, unnecessary services disabled**, and firewall rules tightened. Restrictions are only loosened as required for functionality. | |
| **Privacy by Design** | All confidential data must be **secured at all times from the beginning** of the system design. This principle forms the basis for regulations like GDPR. | |
| **Security Infrastructure**| Deploy appropriate **IAM systems** (e.g., Active Directory using LDAP for centralized authentication), and centralized security systems such as **IPS, SIEM (or other centralized logging)**, and inventory management. | |
| **Continuous Follow-Up** | The **Change Management process** must be in place and followed immediately. Implement a regular **Vulnerability Management program** (e.g., monthly cadence) and routine **audit procedures** to verify baselines. | |

## 4. eEDA Certification Exam Preparation

The eEDA certification examination tests both theoretical knowledge and practical, hands-on abilities required of an Enterprise Defense Administrator.

| Component | Details and Preparation Requirements | Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exam Composition** | The exam consists of **independent questions** (multiple choice, scenario-based) and a **hands-on practical portion with a lab**. | |
| **Practice Environment** | The **EDA Sandbox Environment** is an isolated lab containing various systems, including **Windows (with Active Directory), Linux, and network devices**. | |
| **Key Practice Areas** | Practice technical skills such as configuring **Linux commands**, **firewall rules** (Windows, Linux, and network equipment), **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**, and reviewing **vulnerability and inventory scans**. | |
| **Allowed Resources** | Candidates are permitted to use external resources during the exam, including **command documentation and vendor documentation**, but **NOT other people**. | |
